        description:`Toronto's famous landmark, the 553-meter CN Tower, is one of Ontario's must-see attractions and also the most impossible to miss. Towering above the downtown, this Canadian icon can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. 
            You have the option of simply appreciating the building from the ground, or taking a trip up to one of the 
            observation areas or restaurants for fabulous views over the city and Lake Ontario. The CN Tower, 
            built between 1972 and 1976, was once the tallest freestanding structure in the world, but has long since 
            been surpassed.`,
